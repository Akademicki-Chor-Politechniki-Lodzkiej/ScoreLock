# ScoreLock 🎵

A secure Flask-based web application for managing and sharing sheet music PDFs with one-time password authentication.

## Features

✨ **One-Time Password (OTP) Access** - Share secure, single-use codes for library access
🔐 **Admin Panel** - Full control over scores and OTP management  
📚 **Beautiful Library UI** - Clean, responsive interface for browsing scores
📁 **PDF Management** - Upload, view, and delete PDF sheet music
👥 **Multiple Admins** - Support for multiple administrator accounts

## Screenshots

- **Login Page**: Dual authentication with OTP or admin login
- **Library**: Grid view of all available scores with metadata
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage OTPs, upload scores, and view statistics

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Modern web browser
- (Optional) MySQL or MariaDB database server for production deployments

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ScoreLock.git
cd ScoreLock
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Database Setup

ScoreLock supports two database options:

#### Option A: SQLite (Default - Recommended for Development)

**No setup required!** SQLite is built into Python and requires no separate database server. The database file will be automatically created when you initialize the application.

#### Option B: MySQL/MariaDB (Recommended for Production)

Open MySQL/MariaDB command line or phpMyAdmin and create a database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE scorelock CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

Optionally, create a dedicated user:

```sql
CREATE USER 'scorelock_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON scorelock.* TO 'scorelock_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

**Quick Setup (SQLite):**
```bash
# Windows
setup_sqlite.bat

# Linux/Mac
chmod +x setup_sqlite.sh
./setup_sqlite.sh
```

**Manual Setup:**

Copy the example environment file and edit it:

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` file with your settings:

**For SQLite (default):**
```env
SECRET_KEY=your-very-secret-key-here-change-this-to-random-string
# DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///scorelock.db  (optional, this is the default)
UPLOAD_FOLDER=scores
```

**For MySQL:**
```env
SECRET_KEY=your-very-secret-key-here-change-this-to-random-string
DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://username:password@localhost/scorelock
UPLOAD_FOLDER=scores
```

**Important**: Generate a secure SECRET_KEY. You can use Python:

```python
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

**📖 For detailed database configuration options, switching between SQLite and MySQL, and troubleshooting, see [DATABASE_CONFIG.md](DATABASE_CONFIG.md)**

### 5. Initialize the Database

Run the initialization script to create tables and your first admin user:

```bash
python init_db.py
```

Follow the prompts to create your admin account.

### 6. Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

### For Administrators

1. **Login**: Go to `http://localhost:5000` and use the "Admin Login" tab
2. **Generate OTP**: In the admin dashboard, click "Generate New OTP"
3. **Share OTP**: Copy the generated code and share it with users
4. **Upload Scores**: Use the upload form to add new PDF scores
5. **Manage**: View all scores and deactivate OTPs as needed

### For Users

1. **Access**: Visit the application URL
2. **Enter OTP**: Use the provided one-time password
3. **Browse**: View all available scores in the library
4. **View PDFs**: Click on any score to open the PDF

## Database Schema

### Tables

**admins**
- `id` - Primary key
- `username` - Unique username
- `password_hash` - Hashed password
- `created_at` - Account creation timestamp

**otps**
- `id` - Primary key
- `code` - Unique OTP code
- `is_active` - Active status
- `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- `used_at` - Usage timestamp
- `created_by` - Foreign key to admins

**scores**
- `id` - Primary key
- `title` - Score title
- `composer` - Composer name
- `filename` - Stored filename
- `uploaded_at` - Upload timestamp
- `uploaded_by` - Foreign key to admins

## Creating Additional Admin Users

To create more admin accounts:

```bash
python init_db.py create-admin
```

## Security Considerations

- Always use HTTPS in production (configure with a reverse proxy like nginx)
- Keep your SECRET_KEY secure and never commit it to version control
- Use strong passwords for admin accounts
- Regularly review and deactivate unused OTPs
- Consider setting up database backups
- Limit file upload sizes (default: 50MB)

## Production Deployment

For production deployment, use a WSGI server like Gunicorn:

```bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 main:app
```

Use nginx or Apache as a reverse proxy and enable HTTPS with Let's Encrypt.

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Error

**SQLite:**
- Check if the database file path is writable
- Ensure the application directory has write permissions

**MySQL:**
- Verify MySQL/MariaDB is running
- Check credentials in `.env` file
- Ensure database exists

### Import Errors
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version (3.8+)

### File Upload Issues
- Check `scores/` folder exists and is writable
- Verify file size limits in `main.py`

## Database Comparison

### SQLite
**Pros:**
- ✅ No separate database server required
- ✅ Zero configuration
- ✅ Perfect for development and small deployments
- ✅ Single file database (easy to backup)
- ✅ Cross-platform compatible

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Not ideal for high concurrent writes
- ⚠️ Limited scalability for large deployments

**Best for:** Development, testing, small to medium deployments (< 100 concurrent users)

### MySQL/MariaDB
**Pros:**
- ✅ Better performance with high concurrent users
- ✅ Advanced features and optimizations
- ✅ Industry-standard for production
- ✅ Better for large-scale deployments

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires separate database server
- ⚠️ More complex setup and maintenance

**Best for:** Production environments with many concurrent users
